This is the dataset for metabolomic part of the study. It has two dataset. 1st one is for stable stoma patients metabolomic dataset and 2nd one is the bandit cohort where stoma contents were collected for the metabolomics after feeding. Metabolomic data can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/s/5f84cf321e731a49ae06. 

Ions were annotated based on accurate mass comparison using 3mDa mass tolerance against unique molecular weights of compounds present in the Human Metabolome Database (Wishart et al., 2013). The adj-p-values-value < 0.05 and absolute fold change (log2) > 2 were calculated from quantile-normalized ion counts using Matlab R2020b and used as a cut-off parameter for visualization. One-way ANOVA with Tukeyâ€™s HSD test was used to test the significance of metabolite differences between intestinal locations. Quantile-normalized ion counts were z-score transformed for k-means clustering, and the appropriate number of 10 clusters was determined based on the mean sum of point to centroid distances.. No new code was developed in this study.
